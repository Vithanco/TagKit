# ``TagKit``

TagKit makes it easy to use tags and slugify strings in Swift and SwiftUI.



## Overview

TagKit makes it easy to use tags and slugify strings in Swift and SwiftUI. You can slug and tag any type, customize the slug format, and use the built-in views to list and edit tags with ease.



## Installation

TagKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/danielsaidi/TagKit.git
```

## Getting started

TagKit lets you slugify strings and manage tags for any taggable type.


### Slugs

Slugifying a string means to remove unwanted characters and replacing whitespaces with a separator. This is often used in urls, where a page slug creates a unique, valid url that also describes the content.

TagKit has a ``Swift/String/slugified(with:)`` string extension that lets you slugify strings with a standard or custom ``SlugConfiguration``:

```
let custom = SlugConfiguration(
    separator: "+",
    allowedCharacters: .init(charactersIn: "hewo")
)

"Hello, world!".slugified()             // "hello-world" 
"Hello, world!".slugified(with: custom) // "he+wo"
```

Slugified strings are automatically lowercased, since a slug should be case-insensitively unique.


### Tags

Tagging is the process of adding tags to an item, with the intent to categorize, group, filter and search among tags.

TagKit has a ``Taggable`` protocol that can be implemented by any type that has mutable ``Taggable/tags``:

```swift
public protocol Taggable {

    var tags: [String] { get set }
}
```

Once a type implements ``Taggable``, it can make use of a lot of automatically implemented functionality that the protocol provides, like ``Taggable/hasTags``, ``Taggable/slugifiedTags``, ``Taggable/addTag(_:)``, ``Taggable/removeTag(_:)``, ``Taggable/toggleTag(_:)``. All ``Taggable`` collections are extended as well.


### Views

TagKit has a couple of tag related views, like ``TagList``, ``TagEditList`` and ``TagTextField``.
